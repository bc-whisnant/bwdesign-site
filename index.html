            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3>This is a collection of questions I commonly get asked from other developers or individuals that are aspiring to become a deveolper.</h3>
            <h3>Do you have to go to college to become a developer?</h3>
            <p>You don't have to get a degree or anything to be a developer.  I taught myself to code and never actually went to college. This field is more about experience and capability than anything else.</p>
            <h3>Why do you use Linux and macOS instead of Windows?</h3>
            <p>I actually use Windows at work because that is what the pc they gave me has on it.  I prefer mac or linux because of the extra security and believe the look of those operating systems is far better than Windows.  Before I learned how to code I was an IT professional for about three years.  In that time I got tired of windows and decided to make a switch.  Also, some programs like Sketch App are not available for Windows so I use my macbook for that. In all reality I can code on a Dell from 2005 running Linux and be completely happy. Having a mac is just a perk of the job.</p>
            <h3>What are your goals for the future?</h3>
            <p>I plan on being good at multiple kinds of development.  Professionally I am moving more toward a software developer role using Python currently.  However, I will always work with websites even if it is just something I do in my spare time.</p>
            <h3>If there are any other questions about my path as a developer or future plans please send an email to <a href="mailto:bc.whisnant@gmail.com">bc.whisnant@gmail.com</a></h3>
